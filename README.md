# Canvas Golf
A 3D golf game created in Unity using C#.
## What is this?
This project is purely a learning experience for me to write more code, familiarize myself with C#, challenge myself with 3D graphics programming, and perhaps an opportunity for me to learn some 3D modeling as a hobby.  It is based in part on my 2D Python project, "Project Golf".
## Current Features
- Power bar with moving tickers to start your swing and set power and accuracy.
- Ball receives power and accuracy from the power bar and moves accordingly.
- Try to get the ball in the hole!
